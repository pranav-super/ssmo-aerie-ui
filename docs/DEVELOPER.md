## Prerequisite Knowledge

Before getting started with developing in this repository read/watch all of the following resources:

1. [Rich Harris - Rethinking Reactivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao)
1. [Svelte Tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics)
1. [Svelte Kit Documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs)

## Prerequisite Software

Before you can run aerie-ui you must install and configure the following products on your development machine:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com) and/or the [GitHub app](https://desktop.github.com/); [GitHub's Guide to Installing Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) is a good source of information.

- [Node.js LTS](http://nodejs.org) which is used to run a development web server, and generate distributable files. We recommend using the [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.js and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) on your machine. Once you have NVM installed you can use the required Node.js/NPM versions via:

  ```shell
  cd aerie-ui
  nvm use
  ```

- [OpenJDK Temurin LTS](https://adoptium.net/temurin/) which is used to build the Java-based Aerie services. If you're on OSX you can use [brew](https://brew.sh/):

  ```shell
  brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
  brew install --cask temurin19
  ```

  Make sure you update your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. For example with [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) you can set your `.zshrc` to:

  ```shell
  export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-19.jdk/Contents/Home"
  ```

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) which is used to run the Aerie services.

- [Aerie](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie) which contains the main backend services. You can use the following commands to download, build, and run Aerie:

  (NOTE: For compatibility with VSCode tasks, ensure that both Aerie UI and Aerie repos share the same parent directory and that NVM is installed for node version management)

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie.git
  cd aerie
  cp .env.template .env
  ```

  Fill out the `.env` file with the following default environment variables:

  ```sh
  AERIE_PASSWORD=aerie
  AERIE_USERNAME=aerie
  HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=aerie
  HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET='{ "type": "HS256", "key": "oursupersecretsupersecurekey1234567890" }'
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
  POSTGRES_USER=postgres
  ```

  Next build Aerie, and start the services via Docker:

  Via VSCode tasks: (refer to to the [development section](#development))

  - Run the `Build Aerie` task to build Aerie
  - Run the `Aerie Containers` task, to bring up all the containers

  Via CLI:

  ```sh
  ./gradlew assemble

  # Notice we exclude the aerie_ui since we run it locally (i.e. not in Docker) for development.
  docker-compose up --build --detach aerie_gateway aerie_merlin aerie_scheduler aerie_merlin_worker_1 aerie_merlin_worker_2 aerie_scheduler_worker_1 aerie_scheduler_worker_2 aerie_sequencing hasura postgres
  ```

  To stop and clean the Aerie services:

  Via VSCode task:

  Run the `Clean Aerie` task

  ```sh
  cd aerie
  docker-compose down
  docker rmi aerie_merlin aerie_scheduler aerie_merlin_worker_1 aerie_merlin_worker_2 aerie_scheduler_worker_1 aerie_scheduler_worker_2 aerie_sequencing
  docker volume prune --force
  ./gradlew clean
  ```

  You should stop and clean the Aerie services after each use (e.g. at the end of the day), or right after pulling down the latest changes.

## Code Editor

The recommended editor for developing aerie-ui is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following settings and extensions. You can easily use another editor of your choice as long as you can replicate the code formatting settings.

### Settings.json

Your editor should follow the same settings found in [.vscode/settings.json](../.vscode/settings.json).

### Extensions

1. [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode)
1. [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
1. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
1. [Stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint)
1. [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
1. [GraphQL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql)
1. [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)
1. [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
1. [Task Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spmeesseman.vscode-taskexplorer)

## Getting the Sources

[Clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the aerie-ui repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-ui.git
cd aerie-ui
```

## Installing NPM Modules

Install the JavaScript modules needed to build aerie-ui:

```shell
npm install
```

## Development

Via VSCode task:

Run the `Development` task to start everything including the Aerie containers.

The `Development` task runs the following tasks:

- `Aerie UI`
- `Aerie Containers`
- `Svelte Check`
- `Unit Tests`

Via CLI:

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Since we have observed some issues using [monaco-editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) with the dev server on Firefox, we recommend using Chrome for development.

## Building For Production

Via VSCode task:

Run the `UI Build` task

Via CLI:

Run `npm run build` to build a production version of the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Cleaning

Run the following commands to clean dependencies and build artifacts of aerie-ui. To be safe you should do this anytime you pull down the latest changes.

```sh
cd aerie-ui
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf .svelte-kit
rm -rf build
```

After cleaning you can [re-install NPM modules](#installing-npm-modules) and start development.
